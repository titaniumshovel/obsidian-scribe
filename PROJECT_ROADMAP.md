  - Handle conversion timeouts gracefully

- [ ] **Hugging Face Authentication**
  - Resolve 401 authentication issue properly
  - Implement proper token validation
  - Add clear error messages for token problems
  - Test fresh installation scenarios

### 2. Testing and Validation
- [ ] **Complete Test Plan Execution**
  - Run all tests in `/tests` folder systematically
  - Document test results and any failures
  - Create automated test suite for regression testing
  - Test background operation scenarios

- [ ] **Real-world Usage Testing**
  - Test with various audio formats and sizes
  - Validate speaker diarization accuracy
  - Test concurrent file processing
  - Measure performance with large files

### 3. Documentation and User Experience
- [ ] **README Enhancement**
  - Add unique Obsidian Scribe features (awaiting user list)

  - Include troubleshooting guide
  - Add performance expectations

- [ ] **Instruction Files Update**
  - Detailed step-by-step setup instructions
  - Windows-specific installation notes
  - Hugging Face token setup with screenshots
  - Common error resolution guide

- [ ] **Allow Diarization to be Optional**
  - Diarization takes long time, not always required
  - Allow for optional enable/disable to speed up
  - Document this in the README and other instruction guides

- [ ] **Better File Naming**
  - Give a more user friendly file naming convention
  - Allow for users to name their files

## Medium-term Goals (1-3 Months)

  - Clean up unused files and test scripts
  - Organize test files into documented structure
  - Implement proper logging levels
  - Add configuration validation

### 2. Feature Enhancements
- [ ] **Advanced Audio Processing**
  - Noise reduction capabilities
  - Audio quality enhancement
  - Multiple speaker identification
  - Timestamp accuracy improvements

- [ ] **User Interface Improvements**
  - Progress indicators for long operations
  - Real-time processing status
  - Configuration management UI
  - Error reporting and recovery

### 3. Integration and Compatibility
- [ ] **Obsidian Plugin Integration**
  - Seamless workflow with Obsidian Whisper
  - Automatic file organization
  - Metadata preservation
  - Custom output formatting

## Long-term Vision (6+ Months)

### 1. Versioning Strategy
- **Semantic Versioning**: Implement proper version management
- **Release Channels**: Stable, beta, and development tracks
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain config and API compatibility
- **Migration Tools**: Automated upgrade processes

### 2. Native Application Development
- **Dependency Reduction**: Replace Python dependencies with native code
- **Performance Optimization**: Faster processing and lower memory usage
- **Cross-platform Support**: Windows, macOS, and Linux compatibility
- **Standalone Distribution**: Single-file executable with no external dependencies

### 3. Advanced Features
- **Real-time Processing**: Live audio transcription
- **Cloud Integration**: Optional cloud-based processing
- **Multi-language Support**: International language recognition
- **Custom Model Training**: User-specific speaker recognition

## Technical Debt and Maintenance

### High Priority
1. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error recovery and user feedback
2. **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup of temporary files and processes
3. **Configuration Validation**: Prevent invalid configurations from causing crashes
4. **Logging Standardization**: Consistent logging across all components

### Medium Priority
1. **Code Documentation**: Inline documentation and API references
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in performance metrics and optimization
3. **Security Hardening**: Input validation and secure token handling
4. **Accessibility**: Support for users with disabilities

### Low Priority
1. **Code Refactoring**: Modernize older code patterns
2. **Dependency Updates**: Keep third-party libraries current
3. **Style Consistency**: Enforce coding standards across the project

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- **Processing Speed**: <2x real-time for audio conversion
- **Accuracy**: >95% transcription accuracy for clear audio
- **Reliability**: <1% failure rate for supported file formats
- **Resource Usage**: <500MB RAM for typical operations

### User Experience Metrics
- **Setup Time**: <10 minutes from download to first transcription
- **Error Recovery**: Clear error messages with actionable solutions
- **Documentation Quality**: Users can resolve 90% of issues independently
- **Performance Predictability**: Consistent processing times for similar files

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Hugging Face API Changes**: Could break speaker diarization
- **FFmpeg Compatibility**: Updates might break audio conversion
- **Windows Permission Issues**: Symlink problems could affect new users

### Medium Risk
- **Large File Processing**: Memory issues with very large audio files
- **Concurrent Processing**: Race conditions with multiple files
- **Configuration Complexity**: Users struggling with initial setup

### Low Risk
- **Python Version Compatibility**: Gradual migration to newer versions
- **Third-party Dependencies**: Most are stable and well-maintained
- **Cross-platform Issues**: Primary focus is Windows compatibility

## Resource Requirements

### Development Resources
- **Primary Developer**: Full-time focus on core functionality
- **Testing**: Dedicated testing across different environments
- **Documentation**: Technical writing for user guides and API docs

### Infrastructure Resources
- **Testing Environment**: Multiple Windows configurations
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing and deployment
- **User Support**: Community forum or support channel

### External Dependencies
- **Hugging Face**: Continued access to speaker diarization models
- **OpenAI**: Whisper API availability and pricing
- **FFmpeg**: Ongoing compatibility and feature support

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Debug WebM file detection issue
2. **This Week**: Complete end-to-end testing with real audio
3. **Next Week**: Update all documentation with current state
4. **Month 1**: Implement context management improvements
5. **Month 2**: Begin native application planning
